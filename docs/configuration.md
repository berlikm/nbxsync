## Inheritance Chain

The `inheritance_chain` setting defines which NetBox objects are traversed when resolving Zabbix assignments. Assignments (templates, tags, hostgroups, macros, proxy/server, inventory, configuration groups) made on any object in the chain are inherited by the device or VM being synced, with direct assignments taking priority.

Host interfaces are the exception: they are defined on a Device/VM directly or on a `ZabbixConfigurationGroup`, because an interface needs a per-device endpoint. To apply interfaces to a whole Site, SiteGroup or Region, assign a Configuration Group at that level — its interfaces are then cloned onto every inheriting device with that device's IP (or its out-of-band IP, see `use_oob_ip`).

### Site, SiteGroup, and Region Inheritance

The chain includes paths for site-level inheritance, allowing assignments made at the `Site`, `SiteGroup`, or `Region` level to be inherited by all devices and VMs at that site or below:

| Path | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `['device', 'site']` | The device's site |
| `['site']` | Site (direct) |
| `['site', 'group']` | The site's SiteGroup |
| `['group', 'parent']` | Parent SiteGroup (traverses the full hierarchy) |
| `['site', 'group', 'parent']` | Full path: device → site → group → parent group |
| `['site', 'region']` | The site's region |
| `['region']` | Region (direct) |
| `['region', 'parent']` | Parent region (traverses the full hierarchy) |
| `['cluster', 'site']` | The cluster's site (for VMs) |

For example, assigning a `ZabbixServerAssignment` (proxy) to a `SiteGroup` means every device at every site in that SiteGroup inherits the proxy — no per-device assignment needed.

## Zabbix Template Rules

`ZabbixTemplateRule` allows automatic template assignment based on the device's or VM's platform name. Each rule has a regex pattern that is matched (case-insensitive) against the platform name. When a rule matches, the configured Zabbix template is assigned to the host.

Rules are resolved after all direct and inherited assignments, so explicit `ZabbixTemplateAssignment` objects always take priority.

Each rule can optionally also assign a hostgroup and a tag when the pattern matches — useful for OS-family grouping (e.g. a `Windows` rule that assigns the `Windows by Zabbix agent` template, a `Windows` hostgroup, and an `os_family=Windows` tag in one rule).

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `name` | Human-readable name |
| `pattern` | Regex pattern matched against platform name (case-insensitive) |
| `zabbixtemplate` | Template assigned when the rule matches |
| `zabbixhostgroup` | Optional hostgroup assigned on match (nullable) |
| `zabbixtag` | Optional tag assigned on match (nullable) |
| `enabled` | Enable/disable rule without deleting it |
| `priority` | Lower value = higher priority (rules evaluated in order) |

Patterns are validated at save time (`re.compile`) and every evaluation is bounded to 2 seconds, which protects the worker against catastrophic backtracking. Matching also fails closed: a rule that times out, exceeds the 200-character input bound, or has an invalid stored pattern does not match and is logged, because linking the wrong template is worse than linking none.

## Configuration values

### Source of Truth

The `sot` key determines which system is the Source of Truth: `netbox` or `zabbix`. And as such, which way the sync works. If the SoT is Netbox, data will be synschronized from Netbox to Zabbix. If the SoT is Zabbix, data is synchronized from Zabbix to Netbox - if and where possible (Zabbix doesn't expose all information).

### Statusmapping

The `statusmapping` key influences how certain statusses are interpreted and used. The two models that are to be synchronized are Devices and Virtual Machines. Each of these can be configurated independently of eachother for maximum flexibility.

The key is the `netbox` status whilst the value is the action to be taken in Zabbix.

### Actions

#### enabled

This status results in the host to be enabled in Zabbix

#### disabled

This status results in the host to be disabled in Zabbix

#### deleted

This status results in the host to be deleted from Zabbix

#### enabled_in_maintenance

If a host has this status, it is enabled in Zabbix, but a maintenance period will be configured with this device.

#### enabled_no_alerting

If a host has this status, it is enabled in Zabbix, but it will have a tag with the value "1" appended. By default this tag will be set to 'NO_ALERTING', but this is configurable using the `no_alerting_tag` configuration. This allows for configuration in Zabbix to disable alerting (see [https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/notifications/action])

### backgroundsync

If wanted, system jobs can be used to automatically sync objects

#### objects

This key is used to determine if 'objects' (that is: Devices and/or Virtual Machines) are to be automatically synched to/from Zabbix

##### enabled

Either true or false (default: True). When enabled, a periodic job enumerates all Devices and VirtualMachines that inherit a `ZabbixServerAssignment` (direct or from SiteGroup/Site/Region/Role/Platform/etc.) and enqueues each for sync.

##### interval

Used to determine the interval to sync Devices and Virtual Machines to/from Zabbix, in minutes (default: 60)

Set `objects.interval` to at least 360 (6 hours) for production — a full reconciliation of ~1127 hosts takes ~80 minutes at ~14 hosts/min; intervals shorter than 90 minutes will cause queue overlap.

#### templates

Controls automatic synchronization of Zabbix Templates into NetBox (the same
operation triggered by the `Sync Templates` button on a Zabbix Server).

- **enabled**: Either `True` or `False` (default: `True`)
- **interval**: Interval in minutes between runs (default: `1440` — 24 hours)

This runs as the `Zabbix Sync Templates job` system job. It imports templates
and their macros, computes interface requirements from item types, and removes
orphaned template records that no longer exist in Zabbix.

#### proxies

Controls automatic synchronization of Zabbix Proxies from NetBox to Zabbix.

- **enabled**: Either `True` or `False` (default: `True`)
- **interval**: Interval in minutes between runs (default: `1440` — 24 hours)

This runs as the `Zabbix Sync Proxies job` system job.

#### maintenance

Controls automatic synchronization of Zabbix Maintenance windows from NetBox
to Zabbix.

- **enabled**: Either `True` or `False` (default: `True`)
- **interval**: Interval in minutes between runs (default: `15` — 15 minutes)

This runs as the `Zabbix Sync Maintenance job` system job. Only maintenance
windows that have at least one period and one object assignment are included.
See [Zabbix Maintenance](zabbixmaintenance.md) for details.

### no_alerting_tag

This defines the tag to be set when a host has the 'enabled_no_alerting' status. Use just a string value with no ${ } around the tag. Defaults to 'NO_ALERTING'.

### no_alerting_tag_value

Defines the value to be set to the no_alerting_tag. Defaults to '1'

### maintenance_window_duration

This sets the value of the duration of the maintenance window that is automatically created when a host has the status 'enabled_in_maintenance'
Is defined in seconds; defaults to 3600 (1 hour)

### snmpconfig

Controls which Zabbix host macro names are used to push SNMP credentials
onto hosts. When a `ZabbixHostInterface` of type SNMP has `snmp_pushcommunity`  enabled, nbxSync automatically creates host macros on the Zabbix host carrying  the SNMP community string or SNMPv3 passphrases.

| Key              | Default             | Description                                         |
|------------------|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `snmp_community` | `{$SNMP_COMMUNITY}` | Macro name for the SNMPv1/v2 community string       |
| `snmp_authpass`  | `{$SNMP_AUTHPASS}`  | Macro name for the SNMPv3 authentication passphrase |
| `snmp_privpass`  | `{$SNMP_PRIVPASS}`  | Macro name for the SNMPv3 privacy passphrase        |

All three values must be valid Zabbix user macro names (i.e. starting with `{$` and ending with `}`).

If you also define a `ZabbixMacroAssignment` with the same macro name on a  device, the manually defined value takes precedence over the SNMP-derived one.

### attach_objtag

When `True` (the default), nbxSync automatically pushes two tags onto every Zabbix host it syncs:

- A tag named by `objtag_type` containing the NetBox object type (e.g. `device`, `virtualmachine`, `virtualdevicecontext`).
- A tag named by `objtag_id` containing the NetBox object's database ID.

These tags allow you to navigate from a Zabbix host back to the corresponding  NetBox record, and can be used in Zabbix actions or maintenance tag selectors.

| Key             | Default   | Description                         |
|-----------------|-----------|-------------------------------------|
| `attach_objtag` | `True`    | Enable or disable auto-tagging      |
| `objtag_type`   | `nb_type` | Tag name for the NetBox object type |
| `objtag_id`     | `nb_id`   | Tag name for the NetBox object ID   |

### custom_field_hostname and custom_field_display_name
You can use these fields to map the connection between NetBox and the Zabbix hostname and display name. The device name is used as the default.

### exclude_tag

When set to a non-empty string (e.g. `'do_not_monitor'`), any `ZabbixTagAssignment` with a tag matching this name — whether assigned directly on a Device/VM or inherited from a Role, Platform, Site, SiteGroup, Region, Manufacturer, or Configuration Group — causes the host to be excluded from Zabbix sync entirely. No Zabbix host is created, and an already synced host is removed from Zabbix only when `allow_inherited_deletion` is enabled (see below).

This is useful for excluding device classes that should never be monitored (e.g. desktop PCs, VDI sessions, test lab devices) without removing their Site or Platform assignments.

The tag itself is never pushed to Zabbix — it is only used as a signal during sync resolution and is filtered out before Jinja2 rendering.

Defaults to `''` (empty string = feature disabled).

### allow_inherited_deletion

Controls whether inheritance can delete an existing Zabbix host. Two situations trigger such a deletion: an `exclude_tag` appearing anywhere in the inheritance chain, and a host losing every `ZabbixServerAssignment` (for example because a Site was moved into another SiteGroup). Both can be caused by an edit far away from the device, and deleting a Zabbix host discards its measurement history.

While disabled (the default), nbxsync keeps those hosts and logs each one it would have deleted, with the reason and the Zabbix host ID:

```
Not deleting Zabbix host for switch-01 on Zabbix EU (hostid 10842): exclusion tag "do_not_monitor" requires
deletion, but allow_inherited_deletion is disabled. Enable it to let nbxsync remove the host and its history.
```

Review those log lines after introducing an exclusion tag or restructuring the site hierarchy, then set the setting to `True` to let nbxsync reconcile. Explicit deletions are unaffected: a `statusmapping` entry that maps to `deleted`, and deleting the Device/VM in NetBox, always remove the Zabbix host.

Defaults to `False`.

### adopt_existing_hosts

Controls whether nbxsync may bind to a Zabbix host it did not create. During sync, a host whose technical name matches and that carries the managed identity tags (`nb_type`/`nb_id`, see [Object tagging](#object-tagging)) can either be adopted or reported as a conflict.

Adoption makes NetBox authoritative over that host immediately: its interfaces, templates, macros, tags and inventory are overwritten on the next sync. While disabled (the default), the sync fails with an actionable message naming the host and the setting, and nothing in Zabbix is changed.

Enable it for a controlled migration of hosts that were provisioned by an earlier tool, then turn it off again.

Defaults to `False`.

## Enabling and Disabling Synchronization

Two separate `sync_enabled` flags control whether synchronization to Zabbix is active.

**On `ZabbixServer`**: disabling this stops all synchronization for every host, proxy, maintenance, and template associated with that server. Jobs  will still be enqueued but will exit immediately without making any API calls.

**On `ZabbixServerAssignment`**: disabling this stops synchronization for that specific device/VM assignment only. Other assignments to the same or different Zabbix servers are unaffected.

Both flags must be `True` for a sync to proceed. The "Sync Status" column on the Zabbix Server Assignments list shows a green check only when both the assignment and its server are enabled.
