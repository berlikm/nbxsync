# Dynamic Values

For the `Hostgroup`, `Tag` and `ZabbixHostInventory` objects, values can be dynamically assigned using Jinja2 templates. Static values are, of course, also possible.

## Usage

When creating a `Hostgroup`, `Tag`, or a `ZabbixHostInventory`, you can specify a value, which may be a Jinja2 template. Specifying a template alone does not have any immediate effect; it is the context in which the object is assigned that determines how the Jinja2 template is rendered.

For example, if a Hostgroup is given the value:

```jinja2
{{ object.site.name }}
```

and is applied to a `Device`, it will render as the device's `Site Name`. Here, object refers to the entity to which the assignment is made. This distinction is important: if a `Hostgroup` is assigned to a `DeviceType`, then the `DeviceType` becomes the object—even if the `Hostgroup` is later inherited by a `Device`.

Therefore, using the following template:

```jinja2
{{ object.site.name }}
```

on a `DeviceType` does not make sense, because a `DeviceType` does not have a `Site` attribute.

## Context

Rendering a value is always performed within a context, which provides access to various values. While the object reference has already been explained, there are additional context variables available. These values can be used in the Jinja2 template, by referring to it.

```jinja2
{{ object.site.name }} (via {{ tag }})
```

would be perfectly valid.

### Tag

Tags are rendered within a context that includes the following information:

| Key         | Value                 | Explanation                                                                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| object      | assigned_object       | Refers to the assigned object; this could be a DeviceType, Device, VirtualMachine, etc. During sync, this is overridden with the actual Device/VM being synced, so that Jinja2 templates can access host-level attributes like `object.name` even when the tag is inherited from a Role or Platform. |
| tag         | zabbixtag.tag         | Contains the Zabbix Tag value that this assignment refers to                                 |
| value       | zabbixtag.value       | The value of the Zabbix Tag (typically the Jinja2 template)                                  |
| name        | zabbixtag.name        | The name of the Zabbix Tag                                                                   |
| description | zabbixtag.description | The description of the Zabbix Tag                                                            |

### Hostgroup

Just like tags, hostgroups are rendered in a context:

| Key         | Value                 | Explanation                                                                                  |
|-------------|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| object      | assigned_object       | Refers to the assigned object; this could be a DeviceType, Device, VirtualMachine, etc.      |
| value       | zabbixhostgroup.value | The value of the Zabbix Hostgroup (typically the Jinja2 template)                            |
| name        | zabbixhostgroup.name  | The name of the Zabbix Hostgroup                                                             |

### Host Inventory

Each field on a `ZabbixHostInventory` record is rendered individually. The context is simpler than for tags and hostgroups:

| Key      | Value            | Explanation                                                  |
|----------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| `object` | assigned_object  | The Device, VDC, or VirtualMachine this inventory belongs to |

Because `ZabbixHostInventory` is assigned directly to a Device, VDC, or VM (never to a DeviceType or other inheritance-chain object), `object` always
refers to the host itself. This means device attributes like `object.site.name`, `object.rack.name`, or `object.primary_ip` are always available and always resolve to the correct host.

Note that each field has a maximum character length enforced at render time, values that exceed the limit are silently truncated. The `inventory_mode` field controls how Zabbix treats the inventory:
- `Manual` (the default) means Zabbix only updates inventory via the API, which is how nbxSync writes it. 
- `Automatic` would cause Zabbix to overwrite inventory fields from item values, which conflicts with nbxSync's writes and should generally be avoided.

!!! note
    The `inventory_mode` field determines how Zabbix handles the inventory data.
    - Manual (default) means only nbxSync writes to inventory.
    - Automatic causes Zabbix to overwrite inventory from item values (this conflicts with nbxSync's writes and is not recommended).
    - Disabled turns off inventory entirely for the host.
