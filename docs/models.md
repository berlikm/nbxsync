# Models & Objects

This plugin defines a set of Django models to represent and synchronize NetBox objects with their counterparts in Zabbix.

---

## Core Models

### `ZabbixServer`

This model represents the Zabbix Server where objects are synced from / to.

| Field                | Type         | Description                                                       |
|----------------------|--------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`               | CharField    | Friendly name of the server                                       |
| `description`        | CharField    | Optional description                                              |
| `url`                | URLField     | Full API endpoint URL                                             |
| `token`              | CharField    | API token for authentication                                      |
| `validate_certs`     | BooleanField | Toggle SSL cert validation                                        |
| `sync_enabled`       | BooleanField | Determines if automatic synchronisation from/to Zabbix is enabled |
| `skip_version_check` | BooleanField | Enable/Disable the version check in the Zabbix Utils module       |

Used as the anchor for all synced objects (hosts, templates, etc.).

---

### `ZabbixTemplate`

Maps a template defined in Zabbix.

| Field                    | Type         | Description                              |
|--------------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------|
| `name`                   | CharField    | Template name                            |
| `templateid`             | IntegerField | ID in Zabbix                             |
| `zabbixserver`           | ForeignKey   | Associated `ZabbixServer`                |
| `interface_requirements` | ArrayField   | Required interface types for application |

---

### `ZabbixTemplateAssignment`

Assigns a template to a NetBox object (device, VM, etc.).

| Field                  | Type         | Description                           |
|------------------------|--------------|---------------------------------------|
| `zabbixtemplate`       | ForeignKey   | Linked Zabbix template                |
| `assigned_object`      | Generic FK   | Device, VM, Interface, etc.           |

Templates can be inherited based on device/site hierarchy.

### `ZabbixMacro`

Defines a user macro at the Zabbix Server or Zabbix Template level. These macros apply globally to all hosts on the server or to all hosts using the template.

| Field             | Description                                              |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `macro`           | Macro name, e.g. `{$SNMP_COMMUNITY}`                     |
| `value`           | The macro value                                          |
| `type`            | `Text`, `Secret`, or `Vault secret`                      |
| `description`     | Optional description                                     |
| `assigned_object` | The `ZabbixServer` or `ZabbixTemplate` this belongs to   |

### `ZabbixMacroAssignment`

Assigns a user macro to a specific NetBox object within the inheritance chain (Device, VDC, VM, Manufacturer, DeviceRole, DeviceType, Platform, Cluster, or ClusterType).
Macros assigned here override template-level macros of the same name on the resulting Zabbix host.

| Field             | Description                                                                |
|-------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `zabbixmacro`     | The macro definition to assign                                             |
| `value`           | The value for this assignment (may differ from the macro's default value)  |
| `context`         | Optional context suffix, producing e.g. `{$MACRO:context}`                 |
| `is_regex`        | If `True`, the context is treated as a regular expression                  |
| `assigned_object` | The NetBox object this assignment applies to                               |

### `ZabbixHostInterface`

Describes how NetBox IP/DNS maps to Zabbix interfaces.

Includes rich SNMP and TLS configuration fields.

| Field            | Description                                                          |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ip` / `dns`     | IP or DNS to use                                                     |
| `type`           | Zabbix type (agent, SNMP, IPMI...)                                   |
| `port`           | Connection port                                                      |
| `use_oob_ip`     | Resolve the IP from the device's `oob_ip` instead of a static IP      |
| `tls_*`          | TLS credentials if applicable                                        |
| `snmp_*`         | SNMPv3 credentials                                                   |
| `assigned_object`| Mapped to NetBox interface or device                                  |

#### Out-of-band interfaces

`use_oob_ip` makes an interface follow the device's out-of-band IP instead of a static `ip` or the primary IP, which is how switches, PDUs and servers with a dedicated management port are usually monitored. It is vendor-agnostic: any device with an `oob_ip` works, and setting it on a Configuration Group applies it to every device in that group.

Only Devices have an out-of-band IP, so the field is rejected on Virtual Machines and Virtual Device Contexts.

When a device has no `oob_ip`, the interface is skipped for that device: it is not created, and templates that require it are not linked, so the rest of the host still syncs. An interface that already exists in Zabbix is retained and the skip is logged; it is deleted only when `allow_inherited_deletion` is enabled. This keeps a Configuration Group with an OOB interface usable across a mixed fleet where only part of it is cabled for out-of-band access.

## Sync & Assignment Models

### `ZabbixServerAssignment`

Links a NetBox object to a Zabbix server/host/proxy.

| Field            | Description                                                       |
|------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `zabbixserver`   | Destination server                                                |
| `hostid`         | Zabbix host ID (legacy; prefer `ZabbixHostBinding`)               |
| `zabbixproxy`    | (Optional) specific proxy                                         |
| `assigned_object`| Device, VM, etc.                                                  |
| `sync_enabled`   | Determines if automatic synchronisation from/to Zabbix is enabled |

### `ZabbixHostBinding`

Internal sync identity for the Zabbix host owned by a NetBox Device/VM. There is no UI or public API for bindings by design — operators manage hosts via assignments and sync jobs. Bindings let reconciliation retire a host after an inherited assignment disappears, and they are the durable source for maintenance-window host lists.

| Field             | Description                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `zabbixserver`    | Destination server                               |
| `assigned_object` | Device or VM                                     |
| `hostid`          | Zabbix host ID                                   |
| `hostname`        | Last synced host name                            |

---

### `ZabbixHostgroup` / `ZabbixHostgroupAssignment`

Defines host groups and their mapping.

- `ZabbixHostgroup`: static groups defined in Zabbix
- `ZabbixHostgroupAssignment`: assign them to NetBox objects

#### Nested host groups

Zabbix nesting is a naming convention: `Network/Region/Site` denotes a subgroup, but Zabbix stores no relation between groups. Three consequences:

- Creating `A/B/C` never creates `A` or `A/B`, and Zabbix inherits user-group permissions into a subgroup only if the parent already exists. nbxsync therefore materializes missing path segments parent-first on both creation paths (assignment sync and on-demand creation during host sync).
- Renaming a group never cascades to subgroups. To rename, edit the `ZabbixHostgroup` `value` (the Zabbix-facing name; `name` is only the NetBox label): the stored `groupid` lets sync rename the group in place, keeping hosts and permissions. Changing a Jinja template, by contrast, produces a new path; hosts migrate on the next sync and the old path remains as an empty group.
- Path segments must be non-empty (no leading/trailing/double slashes, no slash escaping); Zabbix rejects such names at the API.

Because nbxsync follows the additive model and never deletes groups, empty groups left behind by template changes are housekeeping handled outside the plugin's sync core.

---

### `ZabbixTag` / `ZabbixTagAssignment`

Tags for classification or automation in Zabbix.

---

### `ZabbixHostInventory`

Maps fields to Zabbix's extensive inventory model.

Includes over 70 fields like:

- `hardware`, `vendor`, `asset_tag`
- `site_city`, `site_address_a`
- `os`, `contact`, `poc_*`, etc.

This is populated from NetBox fields or manually if configured.

---

## Proxy & Group Models

### `ZabbixProxy`

Defines a proxy in Zabbix (with advanced TLS and timeout settings).

### `ZabbixProxyGroup`

Groups multiple proxies for failover management.

## Zabbix Maintenance Models

### `ZabbixMaintenance`

Defines a Maintenance object in Zabbix

### `ZabbixMaintenancePeriod`

Linked to a `ZabbixMaintenance`, defines when the maintenance object comes into play

### `ZabbixMaintenanceObjectAssignment`

Defines the assigned objects (Device/Virtual Device Context/VirtualMachine/ZabbixHostgroup) affected by the Zabbix Maintenace

For Zabbix HostGroups, only statically defined objects are supported - as there is no way to resolve any Jinja2-templated hostgroups without the context of the assigned object

### `ZabbixMaintenanceTagAssignment`

Defines the assigned Zabbix Tags affected by the Zabbix Maintenace

For Zabbix Tags, only statically defined objects are supported - as there is no way to resolve any Jinja2-templated value without the context of the assigned object

## Zabbix Configuration Group Models

### `ZabbixConfigurationGroup`

Models a group of configuration settings (such as `ZabbixServer`, `ZabbixHostInterface` et cetera) that are *replicated* to all assigned Devices, Virtual Device Contexts or VirtualMachines.

Please note that on the `ZabbixHostInterface`, no IP address needs to be entered: upon replicating this to the assigned object, the *primary IP Address* will be used on the `ZabbixHostInterface`

### `ZabbixConfigurationGroupAssignment`

Links a Device/Virtual Device Context/VirtualMachine to a `ZabbixConfigurationGroup` and as such determines the applied configuration on the linked object. Device/Virtual Device Context/VirtualMachines can only be assigned to a single `ZabbixConfigurationGroup`

---

## 🧬 Inheritance Logic

Templates, macros, and hostgroups can be inherited across these chains, by default:

```plaintext
Manufacturer → Device Type    → Platform  → Role  → Device
Manufacturer → Device Type    → Platform  → Role  → Virtual Device Context
Cluster      → VirtualMachine
```

However, this is [configurable](configuration.md).

## Assignment Scope

Not all assignment types can be attached to the same set of NetBox objects.
The table below shows what each model accepts as `assigned_object`.
