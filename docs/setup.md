# Setup

This plugin requires some setup in Netbox to function correctly.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that Netbox can communicate with Zabbix via the [JSON API](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/api). Authentication is performed using a `Token`.

Refer to the [Zabbix Documentation](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/web_interface/frontend_sections/users/api_tokens) for instructions on generating an API token. Take note of the `Expiration date`. For continuous operation, it is recommended to set no expiration, but for security, you should choose what is most appropriate for your environment.

## Step 1: Set Up Zabbix Server

After generating a token, configure a new Zabbix Server in Netbox. Navigate to `Zabbix` -> `Zabbix Servers` in the left-hand menu and click `Add`.

| Field                      | Value   | Description                                                                              |
|----------------------------|---------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name                       | String  | The name of the Zabbix Server; used for reference within Netbox.                         |
| URL                        | URI     | The fully qualified URI of the Zabbix frontend, e.g., `http://192.168.2.31/zabbix`       |
| Validate HTTPS Certificate | Boolean | Whether to validate the SSL certificate when using HTTPS.                                |
| Token                      | String  | The authentication token for accessing Zabbix.                                           |

## Step 2: Synchronize Templates

Next, import all templates from Zabbix into Netbox so they can be referenced later. To do this, go to the Zabbix Server you created in Step 1 and click the `Sync Templates` button in the upper right corner.

A background job will be scheduled. After a few seconds (if everything works as expected), you should see the templates by navigating to the 'Templates' tab on the Zabbix Server object or by browsing the Zabbix Template objects via the `Zabbix` -> `Zabbix Templates` menu.

## Step 3: Configure a Device / Virtual Machine / Virtual Device Context

Configure your Device, Virtual Device Context (VDC) or Virtual Machine as needed, following the steps below. The main requirements are:

1. The Device, VDC or VM must be associated with a Zabbix Server via a Zabbix Server Assignment.
2. A host interface is required in most cases (see Step 3b for details).
3. At least one hostgroup must be assigned.

If these conditions are not met, synchronization will not be possible.

### Step 3a: Assign a Zabbix Server

!!! danger
    A Zabbix Server Assignment is required

First, assign the host to one or more Zabbix Servers. This determines the destination for synchronization. Navigate to the Device, VDC or Virtual Machine, go to the `Zabbix` tab, and look for 'Zabbix Servers' at the top left with a small 'add' button.

When adding an assignment, you can:

- Select the Zabbix Server that should monitor this device.
- Choose the `Zabbix Proxy` or `Zabbix Proxy Group` responsible for monitoring (provided these have already been created in Netbox).

### Step 3b: Configure a Host Interface

!!! note "When is an interface required?"
    Whether an interface is required depends on the templates assigned to the host. nbxSync inspects the item types on each template during the template sync (Step 2) and stores the interface requirements on each `ZabbixTemplate` record. 
    A host interface is **not** required if all assigned templates consist entirely of items that need no interface (e.g. HTTP agent, Script, Calculated, Dependent). 
    In practice, most templates require at least an Agent or SNMP interface. If the Sync button does not work on a device, check that the required interface type matches what the assigned templates expect.

After assigning a Zabbix Server, specify how the Zabbix Server will monitor the Device, VDC or Virtual Machine via a [Host Interface](https://www.thezabbixbook.com/ch04-zabbix-collecting-data/host-interfaces/).

To configure the Host Interface, navigate to the Device, VDC or Virtual Machine, open the `Zabbix` tab, and find 'Host Interfaces' at the top right with an 'add' button.

When adding a host interface assignment, you must specify:

- The Zabbix Server this Host Interface is synced to
- The Type (Agent, SNMP, JMX, or IPMI)
- Whether to connect via IP address or DNS name
- The port number

At minimum, specify the Type, Port, and either IP Address or DNS name.

For Devices with a NetBox out-of-band IP, you can enable **Use OOB IP** instead of a static address. Connect via must be IP. The same option on a Configuration Group resolves each member Device's `oob_ip` at sync time.

### Step 3c: Assign a Hostgroup

!!! danger "Required"
    A Hostgroup assignment is required

!!! note "Hint"
    Hostgroups can be assigned directly to the Device, VDC or VM, or inherited from the DeviceType, Cluster, Manufacturer, Platform, Site, SiteGroup, Region, Tag, etc. Alternatively, Configuration Groups can be used.

Each host in Zabbix requires at least one Hostgroup. Create a hostgroup using the left-hand menu: `Zabbix` -> `Zabbix Hostgroups` and click `Add`. Ensure the hostgroup is associated with the same Zabbix Server. The value can be static or [dynamically rendered using a Jinja2 template](dynamic_values.md).

Once the Hostgroup is created, create a Hostgroup Assignment on the Device or Virtual Machine.

### Step 3d: Assign a Template

!!! note "Hint"
    Templates can be assigned directly to the Device or VM, or inherited from the DeviceType, Cluster, Manufacturer, Platform, Site, SiteGroup, Region, Tag, etc. Alternatively, Configuration Groups can be used.

You can also use a **Zabbix Template Rule** (`Zabbix` → `Zabbix Template Rules`) to assign a template (and optionally a hostgroup and tag) when platform / role / NetBox tags / manufacturer criteria match. Rules run after direct and inherited assignments; see [Zabbix Template Rules](configuration.md#zabbix-template-rules).

## Debugging

If something does not work as expected, relevant information can usually be found in the Netbox logs or Netbox worker logs. If not, enable Debug mode in Netbox for further troubleshooting.

## Triggering Synchronization

Host synchronization can be triggered in three ways. All three paths converge on the same underlying job and produce identical results.

### Sync button in the UI

On the `Zabbix` tab of any Device, VDC, or Virtual Machine, a **Sync** button appears when the host meets the minimum requirements (a Zabbix Server Assignment, at least one resolved host group, and a host interface compatible with the assigned templates). Clicking it immediately enqueues a `synchost` background job for that host.

### Background system job

The `Zabbix Sync Hosts job` runs automatically at the interval configured by `backgroundsync.objects.interval` (default: every 60 minutes). It enumerates Devices, VDCs and VirtualMachines that inherit a `ZabbixServerAssignment` (directly or via Site/SiteGroup/Region/Role/Platform/etc.), and also reconciles hosts that still have a `ZabbixHostBinding`, then enqueues a `synchost` job for each (subject to both `sync_enabled` flags being `True`).

### REST API

A sync can be triggered programmatically via the nbxSync API endpoint:
```
POST /api/plugins/nbxsync/zabbixsync/
```

The request body must include `obj_type` and `obj_id`:
```bash
curl -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  http://<netbox>/api/plugins/nbxsync/zabbixsync/ \
  --data '{"obj_type": "device", "obj_id": 1}'
```

Valid `obj_type` values: `device`, `virtualmachine`, `virtualdevicecontext`.

The response is HTTP 202 with `{"count": 1, "results": [{"scheduled": true}]}`.
The endpoint requires a valid NetBox authentication token but no special nbxSync permissions beyond basic API access.
