# Zabbix Configuration Groups — How They Work

## Overview

A `ZabbixConfigurationGroup` is a **reusable configuration template** that lets you define a set of Zabbix assignments **once** and have them automatically propagated to many NetBox objects.

Think of it as a "profile": you attach Zabbix servers, templates, tags, host groups, macros and host interfaces to the group itself, then assign that group to Devices, VDCs, VirtualMachines, or hierarchy objects such as Site, SiteGroup, Region or Tag. Whenever a member is added to the group, it immediately inherits all of those Zabbix configurations automatically.

---

## Data Model

### `ZabbixConfigurationGroup`

```python
class ZabbixConfigurationGroup(NetBoxModel):
    name = CharField(max_length=512)
    description = CharField(max_length=1024, blank=True)
```

A minimal model, just a name and a description. All the complexity lives in assignments and signals around it. It inherits `NetBoxModel`, giving it standard NetBox features: changelog, tags, custom fields, creation/update timestamps, etc.



### `ZabbixConfigurationGroupAssignment`

```python
class ZabbixConfigurationGroupAssignment(NetBoxModel):
    zabbixconfigurationgroup = ForeignKey('nbxsync.ZabbixConfigurationGroup', ...)
    assigned_object_type     = ForeignKey(ContentType, limit_choices_to=ASSIGNMENT_MODELS, ...)
    assigned_object_id       = PositiveBigIntegerField(...)
    assigned_object          = GenericForeignKey(...)
```

This is the **membership record**: it links a group to a NetBox object in the inheritance set (Device, VDC, VM, Site, SiteGroup, Region, Manufacturer, Role, DeviceType, Platform, Cluster, ClusterType, Tag). A unique constraint prevents the same object from being added to the same group twice.

The important distinction: this is **not** about Zabbix config per se — it is purely about group membership. The actual Zabbix config is stored on the group itself via the normal assignment models (see below).

---

## The Dual Role of Existing Assignment Models

The existing nbxsync assignment models (`ZabbixServerAssignment`, `ZabbixTemplateAssignment`, `ZabbixTagAssignment`, `ZabbixHostgroupAssignment`, `ZabbixMacroAssignment`, `ZabbixHostInterface`) all have two distinct modes of operation:

| Mode                       | `assigned_object` points to  | `zabbixconfigurationgroup` field |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| **Direct assignment**      | A Device / VM / VDC          | `NULL`                           |
| **Group-level definition** | A `ZabbixConfigurationGroup` | `NULL`                           |
| **Group-cloned copy**      | A Device / VM / VDC          | FK to the originating group      |

The `zabbixconfigurationgroup` FK on each assignment model is the "provenance" marker: a non-null value means this record was **created by the group propagation system**, not by a human directly. This matters for the "don't overwrite manual assignments" logic (described below).

The `ASSIGNMENT_MODELS` constant is intentionally broader than `DEVICE_OR_VM_ASSIGNMENT_MODELS` — it includes manufacturer, device role, device type, cluster, etc. — so group-level definitions (`assigned_object = ZabbixConfigurationGroup`) are technically stored using the same generic FK pattern used for all direct assignments.

---

## How Propagation Works — Step by Step

When a device or VM is added to a group, the system propagates every piece of Zabbix config from the group to that device. This flow is driven by **Django signals** that dispatch **RQ background jobs**, which in turn execute the actual database mutations safely after the transaction commits.

### Step 1 — Membership is saved

A `ZabbixConfigurationGroupAssignment` is created or updated (device → group link).

### Step 2 — `post_save` signal fires and enqueues an RQ job

```python filename="test"
@receiver(post_save, sender=ZabbixConfigurationGroupAssignment)
def handle_postsave_zabbixconfigurationgroupassignment(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if instance.zabbixconfigurationgroup is None:
        return

    propagate_configgroup_assignment.delay(instance.pk)
```

The signal does not run propagation inline. It enqueues a `propagate_configgroup_assignment` background job on the RQ `low` queue and returns immediately, so the HTTP request that triggered the save is not blocked.


### Step 3 — The job runs `resync_zabbixconfigurationgroupassignment`

A worker picks up the job and calls `PropagateConfigGroupAssignmentJob.run()`, which calls `resync_zabbixconfigurationgroupassignment(instance)` — the main propagation engine in `utils/cfggroup/resync_zabbixconfiggroupassignment.py`.

For each assignment type it:

1. Looks up all group-level definitions for this config group (e.g. all `ZabbixServerAssignment` records where `assigned_object = this_configgroup`).
2. For each one, calls `propagate_group_assignment()`.

### Step 4 — `propagate_group_assignment` iterates members

```python
def propagate_group_assignment(*, instance, model, lookup_factory, ...):
    def _do():
        for assigned in iter_configgroup_members(instance):
            lookup = lookup_factory(instance, assigned)

            # Don't overwrite manual (non-group-sourced) assignments
            existing = model.objects.filter(**lookup).first()
            if existing is not None and getattr(existing, respect_existing_null_group_field) is None:
                continue

            defaults = build_defaults_from_instance(instance, exclude=..., extra={'zabbixconfigurationgroup': ...})

            try:
                model.objects.update_or_create(**lookup, defaults=defaults)
            except IntegrityError:
                model.objects.filter(**lookup).update(**defaults)

    transaction.on_commit(_do)
```

`iter_configgroup_members()` queries all `ZabbixConfigurationGroupAssignment` records for the group, giving us every device/VM that belongs to the group.

For each member, it upserts the assignment record on that device, copying all non-excluded fields from the group-level definition and stamping `zabbixconfigurationgroup` with the group FK.

The actual mutations are wrapped in `transaction.on_commit(_do)`, so they only execute after the job's own database transaction commits. This prevents partial state from ever being visible.

### Step 5 — Special handling for HostInterfaces

Host interfaces get separate treatment because they require an IP address. After all other assignment types are processed, a `transaction.on_commit` callback runs the interface propagation:

```python
for parent in hostinterface_parents:
    for assigned in iter_configgroup_members(parent):
        primary_ip = getattr(assigned.assigned_object, 'primary_ip', None)
        if not primary_ip:
            continue  # skip devices with no primary IP

        ZabbixHostInterface.objects.update_or_create(
            **lookup,
            defaults={..., 'ip': primary_ip, 'dns': primary_ip.dns_name, ...}
        )
```

Because the group-level `ZabbixHostInterface` has no IP (it can't — it's on the group, not a device), a normal interface pulls the device's `primary_ip` at propagation time. The group-level record stores the interface type, port, SNMP config etc., and the IP is injected per-device.

Interfaces with `use_oob_ip` are different: sync-time expansion (including Site/SiteGroup/Region membership) leaves `ip` empty and resolves each Device's NetBox `oob_ip` during host sync. There is no primary-IP fallback for OOB interfaces.

---

## The Reverse: Cleanup on Removal

When a `ZabbixConfigurationGroupAssignment` is deleted (device leaves the group), the `post_delete` signal enqueues a cleanup job:

```python
@receiver(post_delete, sender=ZabbixConfigurationGroupAssignment)
def handle_postdelete_zabbixconfigurationgroupassignment(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    if instance.zabbixconfigurationgroup is None:
        return

    delete_configgroup_assignment_children.delay(
        configgroup_pk=instance.zabbixconfigurationgroup.pk,
        assigned_object_type_pk=instance.assigned_object_type_id,
        assigned_object_id=instance.assigned_object_id,
    )
```

The `DeleteConfigGroupAssignmentChildrenJob` that runs in the worker removes all group-cloned assignments from the departing device across every assignment type:

```python
ZabbixServerAssignment.objects.filter(**filter_kwargs).delete()
ZabbixTemplateAssignment.objects.filter(**filter_kwargs).delete()
ZabbixTagAssignment.objects.filter(**filter_kwargs).delete()
ZabbixHostgroupAssignment.objects.filter(**filter_kwargs).delete()
ZabbixMacroAssignment.objects.filter(**filter_kwargs).delete()
ZabbixHostInterface.objects.filter(**filter_kwargs).delete()
```

Only records stamped with this group's FK are deleted. Manually created assignments (where `zabbixconfigurationgroup=NULL`) are untouched.

---

## Bidirectional Sync: Group Config Changes Propagate Too

When a group-level assignment is **created or updated** (e.g. you add a new Zabbix template to the group), the assignment model's own `post_save` signal enqueues a targeted propagation job:

```python
@receiver(post_save, sender=ZabbixServerAssignment)
def handle_sync_zabbixserverassignment(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    if not is_configgroup_assignment(instance):
        return  # Only act on group-level definitions

    propagate_server_assignment.delay(instance.pk)
```

`is_configgroup_assignment()` checks whether `assigned_object_type` points to `ZabbixConfigurationGroup`. If it does, the corresponding propagation job is enqueued. If it's a direct device/VM assignment, nothing happens.

Each assignment type has its own pair of propagation and cleanup jobs (`propagate_server_assignment` / `delete_server_assignment_clones`, `propagate_template_assignment` / `delete_template_assignment_clones`, and so on). When a group-level assignment is **deleted** (e.g. a template is removed from the group), the matching delete job removes the cloned assignments from all current group members.

---

## The "Don't Overwrite Manual Assignments" Guard

A subtle but important safety mechanism: if a device already has a direct (non-group) assignment for the same Zabbix server/template/etc., the propagation system **skips it**:

```python
existing = model.objects.filter(**lookup).first()
if existing is not None and getattr(existing, 'zabbixconfigurationgroup') is None:
    continue
```

If `zabbixconfigurationgroup` is `None` on the existing record, it means a human put it there manually. The propagation leaves it alone and does not overwrite it with the group-sourced version.

---

## `resync_all_assignments` — Manual Re-trigger

The `ZabbixConfigurationGroup` model exposes a `resync_all_assignments()` method:

```python
def resync_all_assignments(self):
    for assignment in self.zabbixconfigurationgroupassignment.all():
        resync_zabbixconfigurationgroupassignment(assignment)
```

This iterates all current members of the group and re-runs the full propagation for each. Useful when you want to force a full resync — e.g. after bulk-importing group members, or after fixing a bug.

## Key Design Properties

| Property                 | Detail                                                                                                                                              |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Generic FK pattern**   | Groups are assigned to devices the same way any other NetBox object is, using `ContentType` + `object_id`                                           |
| **Provenance tracking**  | Cloned records carry a `zabbixconfigurationgroup` FK so they can be distinguished from manual assignments and cleaned up correctly                  |
| **Non-destructive**      | Manual (non-group) assignments on a device are never overwritten by propagation                                                                     |
| **Asynchronous**         | All propagation runs in RQ background jobs on the `low` queue, so the request that triggered the change returns immediately without blocking the UI |
| **Transactionally safe** | Within each job, DB mutations run inside `transaction.on_commit()` callbacks, so partial state is never exposed                                     |
| **Bidirectional**        | Changes to group membership AND changes to group-level config both trigger propagation                                                              |
| **IP injection**         | Host interfaces are a special case: the IP is pulled from the device's `primary_ip` at propagation time, not stored on the group                    |
